# üõ©Ô∏èRaspberry Pi Pico-W Based Mini Drone  

## Project Overview
This project is a Raspberry Pi Pico W‚Äìbased mini drone designed for hands-on experimentation with wireless control, sensor fusion, and flight stabilization. It uses coreless DC motors, an MPU-6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, and a Li-Po battery powered through a DC-DC boost converter. The drone connects to a mobile app via Wi-Fi for real-time flight control and telemetry.
The total build weight is approximately 210 grams, making it lightweight and suitable for indoor and short-range outdoor flight tests, controlled wirelessly via the custom **AirM Mobile App (v1.1)**.

## Control System ‚Äì AirM App v1.1 (Andriod App)

The **AirM Mobile App** (Android) connects to the Pico W via Wi-Fi.

**App Features:**
- Real-time throttle, pitch, yaw, and roll control  
- Live gyro feedback display  
- Wi-Fi Direct / Hotspot connection  
- Optional telemetry via MQTT or HTTP  

**Communication:**  
Uses **UDP/TCP packets** between the AirM App and Pico W firmware.

## Firmware (Raspberry Pi Pico W)

**Language:** MicroPython / C++  

### Tasks:
1. Connect to Wi-Fi network (AirM App Hotspot)  
2. Read MPU-6050 data (gyro + accel)  
3. Compute PID for stabilization  
4. Control motor PWM outputs  
5. Receive commands via socket communication  

#### firmware is self-designed with company support, optimized for efficient motor response and stable flight performance.
